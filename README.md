# TectalLNP
Linear-nonlinear-Poisson OT network simulation (Zylbertal, A & Bianco, IH (2023). 'Recurrent network interactions explain tectal response variability and experience-dependent behaviour'. eLife, https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.78381)

Based on Pillow et al., 2008 (https://github.com/pillowlab/GLMspiketools)

Run the script 'run_example.m' to simulate and display ongoing tectal activity
